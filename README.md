# Mapty-APP
This application provides workout options based on the user's location. It uses the browser to access the current location and then displays a map on which the user can start a workout by clicking on one of the options, such as running or cycling. The app is implemented using object-oriented programming (OOP), with a parent "Workout" class and child classes for specific types of workouts like running and cycling. The "APP" class manages the data and user interface of the entire application, including creating instances of the various workout classes.
